Hello, I’m @tasnim301.
I am a final-year Computer Science student specializing in Software Engineering and Information Systems, with a strong interest in software development, web technologies, and artificial intelligence.
I am currently enhancing my skills in Python, Java, PHP, HTML/CSS, SQL, and frameworks such as Angular and Spring Boot, alongside experience with Git, Docker, and cloud platforms.
I am seeking opportunities to contribute to open-source projects and internships to gain practical experience and apply my knowledge in real-world projects.
